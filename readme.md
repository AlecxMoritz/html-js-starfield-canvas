# Starscape Canvas
Initially created off the base project for this [tutorial](http://thenewcode.com/81/Make-A-Starfield-Background-with-HTML5-Canvas "Starfield HTML Canvas"). 

## Additions
All in vanilla JavaScript

* Canvas can resize itself to fit any viewport
* Styled with a set of six hex colors chosen at random
* Gave the stars three speeds as they 'fly' across the screen
* Some stars are able to grow and do so and in four step phase to increase animation smoothness. At creation they are set either to expand to retract, and are able to go between the two settings.
